#  ðŸŽ²Ziel 15 - CLIðŸŽ²
This is the repository of the educational project Ziel 15 (engl. goal 15)
## What is the game?
In Ziel 15, multiple players compete to get as close to 15 points as possible. The players throw a dice ðŸŽ² and then choose if they want to add the number to their score. The twist: You throw a custom amount of times, but can only skip a few of them. Combine Luck and Skill to win the game.

## How is it Built?
This Version of Ziel 15 is build in two seperate ways, both combined in this repo.
### C# .NET
The Version that is currently being developed is written in .NET 9 and C# in Microsoft Visual Studio. Feel free to contribute here.
### Java
The development of the Java version has not yet started, due to it being a project built for educational purposes in cooperation with other people. Please DO NOT try to commit.
